# Network Spoofing Script

## Overview

This Python script provides a comprehensive framework for performing network spoofing techniques including ARP, DNS, MAC, and IP address spoofing. It allows you to manipulate network traffic by spoofing various network elements such as IP addresses and MAC addresses.

### Features

1. **ARP Spoofing**: Spoof ARP packets between a victim and a router to intercept or modify traffic.
2. **DNS Spoofing**: Intercept DNS requests and send spoofed responses to redirect traffic.
3. **MAC Address Spoofing**: Change the MAC address of your network interface to impersonate another device.
4. **IP Address Spoofing**: Craft packets with a spoofed source IP address to disguise the origin of the traffic.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Required Python packages: `scapy`, `colorama`

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-spoofing.git
cd network-spoofing
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
python arp_spoof.py
```

### Choosing Spoofing Options

-   **ARP Spoofing**: Select option 1 from the menu. Follow the prompts to enter the victim's IP address and the router's IP address.
-   **DNS Spoofing**: Select option 2 from the menu. Follow the prompts to enter the victim's IP address and the router's IP address.
-   **MAC Address Spoofing**: Select option 3 from the menu. Follow the prompts to enter the network interface and the new MAC address.
-   **IP Address Spoofing**: Select option 4 from the menu. Follow the prompts to enter the target IP address and the spoofed IP address.

**Exiting the Script**: Type `q` or `quit` to exit the script at any time.

### Screenshots

Screenshots will be added soon to demonstrate the usage and output of the script.
